# DateTimeCompressionRateInPBI
Contains SQL code to create a bigger version of FactIntrenetSales from AdventureWorks and PBIX files based on the table to analyze PBI's compression rate.

For the first two files, I had to upload the pbit files since they were larger than 25 MB which is the limit for my GitHub. For the pbit files, point them to AdventurWorks with the modified tables and refresh to load data.
